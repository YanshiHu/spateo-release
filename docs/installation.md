# Installation

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have at least Python 3.7 installed. Spateo does not officially support earlier Python versions.

## Installation

Spateo can be installed either by downloading a release uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI), or the most up-to-date version directly from our GitHub repository.

### PyPI

The following command will download and install the most recent release of Spateo.

```
pip install spateo-release
```

### GitHub

To have access to the most up-to-date version (which may include features not yet in the PyPI version), Spateo can be installed directly from the `main` branch of our GitHub repository.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release
```

To install Spateo from a specific GitHub branch,

```
pip install git+https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release@{branch}
```

where `{branch}` is the branch name.
